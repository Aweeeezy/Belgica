        In this article, I’d like to reacquaint you with the humble workhorse
        of communication that is the paragraph. Paragraphs are everywhere. In
        fact, at the high risk of stating the obvious, you are reading one now.
        Despite their ubiquity, we frequently neglect their presentation. This
        is a mistake. Here, we’ll refer to some time-honored typesetting
        conventions, with an emphasis on readability, and offer guidance on
        adapting them effectively for devices and screens. We’ll see that the
        ability to embed fonts with @font-face is not by itself a solution to
        all of our typographic challenges.
